# Cooking Recipe Website

After cloning project use the following commands in vscode  
 -npm install  
 -npm start

# **Incomplete!**

### List of features still needed:

- Json data moved to a DB
- Import API via axios
- Searchbar that filters user input and hides any non-matching recipe titles on page
- Selecting edit button after selecting a recipe checkbox should open a modal with fields  
  defined from selected recipe for editing.
- Selecting delete button after selecting recipe checkbox should bring up new modal asking  
  for verifaction of deletion.
- Yes or no buttons need to be defined in deletion modal.
- Selecting save button in create/edit modal should save user input to DB
- Styling for recipe pages needs to be addressed

### **Current Bugs**

- Entering anything in the searchbar will error page

**This repo contains only the front end of the application  
please see CapstoneAPI repo for backend.**

## Design by: Kyle Melton

**Summary:** A webpage to write, edit, store, and organize cooking recipes.\
The page itself will have a search bar and/or buttons to search for keywords (i.e., recipe names, lunch/dinner/breakfast) and have the display update on page.

**Problem:** It can be difficult to keep track and update recipes on paper \
**Solution:** Creates a digital platform to make recipes easily accessible

**MVP:** A responsive webpage that can take in user input and display data on page useing ReactJS. \
Use .Net framework and C# as the backend API, and SQL/SSMS for storing the data.
