# Cooking Recipe Website

__This repo contains only the front end of the application  
please see CapstoneAPI repo for backend.__

## Design by: Kyle Melton

__Summary:__ A webpage to write, edit, store, and organize cooking recipes.\
The page itself will have a search bar and/or buttons to search for keywords (i.e., recipe names, lunch/dinner/breakfast) and have the display update on page. 

__Problem:__ It can be difficult to keep track and update recipes on paper \
__Solution:__ Creates a digital platform to make recipes easily accessible

__MVP:__ A responsive webpage that can take in user input and display data on page useing ReactJS. \
Use .Net framework and C# as the backend API, and SQL/SSMS for storing the data.

## Training Plan
I plan to revisit parts of the already completed training and follow similar trainings from other sites. \
Time for completion of training will vary depending on my familiarity with the material.
